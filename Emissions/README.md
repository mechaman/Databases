############################ Emissions Queries ###############################
WELCOME!~
The instructions are straight forward.
1. Make sure to change the parameters in conn = DB.connect("dbname='Mechaman'") to have the name of your database (instead of Mechaman) in Load.py, Query.py.
2. Make sure no databases exist with the ones mentioned.
3. Run the file Load.py with the following command: "python Load.py"
4. Now your databases should be populated with tables Trip, Vehicle, etc. 
5. To run the queries for problems 3 and 5, run "python Query35.py"
