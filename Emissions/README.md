## Emissions Queries
WELCOME!~<br>
The following queries are done in Python using Psycopg2. The databases setup are Postresql.
The instructions are straight forward.<br>
1. Make sure to change the parameters in conn = DB.connect("dbname='Mechaman'") to have the name of your database (instead of Mechaman) in Load.py and Query.py.<br>
2. Make sure no databases exist with the ones mentioned.<br>
3. Run the file Load.py with the following command: "python Load.py"<br>
4. Now your databases should be populated with tables Trip, Vehicle, etc.<br> 
5. To run the queries , run "python Query.py"<br>
